        Provide insights about IP Addresses which tell about IPs are suspicious, malicious or informational.
        The foundation API gets critical information about single and multiple IPs. The
        foundation API contains the data which includes autonomous system Information (AS Info), tags, Insights
        etc. Based on various IPs the data list includes the critical information regarding each IP. 
        Based on Insights, users can find the IP rating such as suspicious etc. Insights appear on an IP address's summary view and offer useful information at a glance such as:

        1. Combinations of malicious tags
        2. Suspicious activities
        3. Peculiar domains
        4. Recently expired domain records
        
        Insights are sorted by rank of descending maliciousness (malicious, suspicious, followed by informational). 
        The overall rating of the IP is determined by the most malicious insight. A maximum of ten insights are shown per IP Address searched.

        Provide IP information such as identity, communication (comms), passive DNS, open ports, x.509 certificate, fingerprints, WHOIS and summary

        The  IP detail endpoint allows users to retrieve a comprehensive report about a specific IP address. The report includes detailed information about the IP address's communication history, including open ports, protocols, and associated domains. 
        Users can get the IP address's X.509 certificates, fingerprints, and associated whois data. 
        By specifying the start and end dates for the response, users can gain insights into the IP address's relationships with specific times. 
        Additionally, users can specify the number of days for which the report should be generated, allowing them to analyze the IP address's history in more detail.
        Scout is a threat investigation and hunting platform used to identify and track malicious infrastructure on the internet. By using the IP detail endpoint the user can find the following things about the IP address.
        
        The details page separates information about a searched IP Address into various sections.
        Summary: The summary section shows summary information for the queried IP Address.
        Communication (Comms): The communications section contains aggregated network traffic information for the queried IP Address.
        Open Ports: The open ports section contains open port banner information obtained from devices connected to the Internet. This data is continuously updated as multiple servers scan IP address ranges for open ports and attempt to retrieve information on the service it is advertising. The banner field can contain items like the returned web server header, SSH banner or X.509 PEM certificate and the service field may contain the identified service tied to the banner (ssh, HTTP).
        PDNS: The Passive Domain Name System (PDNS) section contains Passive DNS resource records returned by public DNS servers. The Passive Domain Name System (PDNS) dataset contains many different record types. It can be used to establish which A records have been observed for a domain of interest, which name servers have been tied to a certain domain and which MX (mail server) or SOA records are known. These records are collected by passive monitoring of DNS query responses.
        X.509: The X.509 section contains information on public key infrastructure (PKI) digital certificates collected through active probing of devices running SSL on public IP addresses.
        Fingerprints: The fingerprints section tab contains the three possible fingerprint hash values are JA3, JA3S, and JARM. The JA3 fingerprint dataset contains passive a TLS (and predecessor SSL) fingerprint for the client (JA3) and a fingerprint for the server (JA3S). This dataset can be used to identify the likely application used by the client and server, as well as identify IP addresses of command and control servers that use a distinctive JA3 fingerprint. The JARM fingerprint dataset contains active/scanning of candidate IP addresses and the resultant TLS session negotiation between the client and server. When the scan initiates 10 TLS Client Hello packets a candidate IP address and captures specific attributes of the TLS Server Hello responses a TLS session. During the handshake, the client shares the TLS libraries/methods it supports. The server shares which libraries/methods it supports. The TLS negotiations are exchanged in clear text, allowing the supported libraries to identify likely applications used by the client and server. The distinct IPs column indicates we have observed the fingerprint hash on the following number of IPs during the search period.
        Whois: The whois section shows Whois information for the IP Address.

        The Scout search endpoint a list of search results using the Scout query language. When a query is provided, this
        endpoint will search based on the query. This endpoint leverages the Scout query language to return a list of
        search results, which contains the list of IPs. Provide a query to initiate a search. Results can be filtered by
        the 'query', 'start_date', and 'end_date' parameters. Optionally, use the 'days' parameter to specify a relative
        date range. The 'size' parameter allows control over the number of records returned.

        The query can accept the following formats, such as IP address, domain name, website, or an advanced query using selectors.

Some of the IP addresses tagged as a SCANNER may have additional child tags that provide more insight into the activity. For example, SHODAN or CENSYS child tags may be used to tag IP addresses from known vendors that scan the Internet, or child tags such as SSH-SCANNER are used to identify scanning activity observed at scanning port 22 (SSH)."
